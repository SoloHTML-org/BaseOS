# BaseOS
This is a new base operating system build on top of actual UNIX systems but with a new system structure.

The objective of this project is to make a new base system taking the best of actual OSes.

Many decisions must to be taken to improve the final version of this new project - for example if it should be a real time operating system or a shared time OS.

New filesystem structure or even a new filesystem is a mandatory part of this project, but these decisions must be also taken by the community.
